<p>If you choose to play PUBG mobile like a seasoned you need to have a surely good trip and knowledge of all the maps, There are many spots in erangel which can supply you a good loot in commencing of the recreation and also don’t have a lot of gamers landing there in starting.
Don’t straight away head for pochinki, Georgopol or navy base if you are a Beginner as they are extraordinarily populated areas. Go to places like Mylta power, farm, Rozhok, and even ruins is top sometimes.</p>
<p>BGMI, short for Battlegrounds Mobile India, features the highly popular Erangel map, which boasts a wide variety of landing spots and loot opportunities. Playing a match on this map provides an immersive gaming experience, and a single round can offer hours of intense gameplay.
For those who seek enjoyment in the game, just a couple of matches on Erangel are enough to fulfill their desire for thrilling gameplay</p>
<P>The Erangel map offers multiple landing locations, but only a select few can significantly increase your chances of securing a chicken dinner.
If you are interested in discovering these optimal landing spots, as per HT Tech, here is the list of places on the Erangel map where you can touch down</P>
<H2>Best spots in Erangel for loot</H2>
<pre>
    <b>Military Base</b>
    To enhance your chances of winning on the Erangel map, consider landing at the Military Base. Situated at the map's southernmost point, it is a high-risk area that offers both potential kills and abundant loot.
     The site boasts numerous structures, such as barracks, warehouses, and offices, providing ample loot opportunities and cover.
    
    <b>Sosnovka Island</b>
    Sosnovka Island, positioned in the corner of the Erangel map, is a relatively underutilized drop spot. 
    It promises a respectable loot yield and is an excellent option for players who favor a more gradual start before diving into intense combat situations.
    
    <b>Yasnaya Polyana</b>
    This is among the largest loot spots, offering an abundance of supplies and gear. While the chances of encountering opponents here are moderate, 
    it is worth noting that the final play zone frequently converges on this area, granting you an advantageous position for the ultimate victory.

<H2><B>Experince of BGMI</B></H2>
<P>Battlegrounds brings drama and excitement into the game. The combo is what makes the game so interesting to watch, regardless of any streamers individual skill-level.
With each game, you go through strong emotional moments: the elation of finding an AWM, the nerves as footsteps creep into the house, or the relief after a successful combat.
Ultimately, it isn’t a spectator game about winning or losing, but a series of narrative ordeals, most of which end with a bullet or crossbow</P>
<P> I personally opt for an ump 9 or m416 greater than an akm. Search for a sniper rifle like Mini 14 or kar 98 or M24 are my favorite. For ar(assault rifle) you can use a scar l or an m416 (its better than m16a4 because of an auto shoot as there is burst shoot in m16a4 ).</P>
